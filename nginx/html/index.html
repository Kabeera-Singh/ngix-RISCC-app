                    interested in identifying and locating plants that support ecosystem function and are likely to
                    persist with climate change. Our tools focus on the northeastern U.S. from Kentucky to Maine
                    with informational resources that may be relevant more broadly. Our work is led by members of
                    the <a href="https://people.umass.edu/bethanyb/">Spatial Ecology Lab at the University
                        of Massachusetts Amherst</a> in collaboration with the <a

                <h2>Why native plants?</h2>
                <p>Native plants, defined as species historically found growing without human intervention in a given
                    location, provide substantial ecological benefits including increasing the abundance of native birds
                    and pollinators (<em>learn more </em><a
                        href="https://www.risccnetwork.org/research-summaries/impact-of-native-plants-on-bird-and-butterfly-biodiversity-in-suburban-landscapes?rq=tallamy"><em>here</em></a><em>
                        and </em><a
                        href="https://www.risccnetwork.org/research-summaries/tartaglia2024"><em>here</em></a>). Native
                    plants are also far less likely to cause ecological harm than species introduced from other
                    continents (<a

                <h2>Why climate-smart?</h2>
                <p>On their own, native species are moving much too slowly to 'keep up' with the rapid pace
                    of climate change (<a href="https://www.risccnetwork.org/research-summaries/bradley2024"><em>learn
                            more</em></a>). To build ecological resilience to climate change, ecologists have suggested
                    use of warm-adapted genotypes over local genotypes and planting warm-adapted plants beyond the
                    margins of their historical ranges (<a

                            Identify potential seed sources for a restoration project. This tool identifies potential
                            seed or plant sourcing locations for target native species based on current and future
                            climate projections at a user-defined location. It also identifies plant species of multiple
                            functional types likely to occur there as climate warms.
